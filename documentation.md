# 📝 Project Diary: Parkinson's Dataset Preparation

## 📅 April 20-26, 2025
During this week, I focused on data mining and organizing datasets related to Parkinson's disease hand-drawing analysis (spirals and waves). I gathered approximately 3,500 data samples from various sources and consolidated them into a structured format. Below is the breakdown of the datasets used:

### 🗃️ Dataset Used Path

This project utilizes multiple datasets related to Parkinson’s disease hand-drawing analysis (spirals and waves).  
Below are the datasets organized and described based on their structure:

## 📅 April 28, 2025
Today, I began the process of resizing all collected images to a uniform size of 512x512 pixels. This step is crucial for ensuring consistency in the dataset for training the database model. Additionally, I started annotating the images to prepare them for further analysis and model training.

### 🛠️ Tasks Completed:
- Resized images to 512x512 pixels.
- Began annotating the dataset for training purposes.
