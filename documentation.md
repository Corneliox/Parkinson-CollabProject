# 📝 Project Diary: Parkinson's Dataset Preparation

## 📅 April 20-26, 2025
During this week, I focused on data mining and organizing datasets related to Parkinson's disease hand-drawing analysis (spirals and waves). I gathered approximately 3,500 data samples from various sources and consolidated them into a structured format. Below is the breakdown of the datasets used:

### 🗃️ Dataset Used Path

## 📅 April 28, 2025
Today, I began the process of resizing all collected images to a uniform size of 512x512 pixels. This step is crucial for ensuring consistency in the dataset for training the database model. Additionally, I started annotating the images to prepare them for further analysis and model training.

### 🛠️ Tasks Completed:
- Resized images to 512x512 pixels.
- Began annotating the dataset for training purposes.

## 📝 Resize Method Explanation

In the dataset pre-processing step, all hand-drawing images were resized to a fixed dimension of **512 × 512 pixels** using the **LANCZOS resampling method**.

---

### 📏 Why Resizing?

- To standardize the input dimensions for the YOLO models.
- To ensure consistent training and inference performance across the dataset.

---

### 📐 Why 512×512?

- **512** is a common size that balances:
  - Detail preservation
  - Computational efficiency
- It is a good compromise between memory usage and model accuracy, especially important when handling medical image datasets.

---

### 🔍 Resizing Method Used

- **LANCZOS interpolation** (also known as Lanczos resampling).

---

### 🧠 About LANCZOS

- A **high-quality resampling algorithm** based on the sinc function.
- Designed for **both downscaling and upscaling** images.
- Preserves **more fine details** compared to simpler methods like bilinear or nearest neighbor.
- Especially effective when high accuracy in preserving edges and fine details is important — **critical for medical datasets**, such as Parkinson's hand-drawing tasks.

---

### 🛠 Technical Note

- Implemented via **Python's Pillow (PIL) library**.
- Accessed by using the flag: `Image.LANCZOS`.
- It is considered **the best choice** when resizing datasets where fine-grained distortions (e.g., tremors in spiral drawings) must be preserved.

---

### 📚 Short Summary for Report

> All images were resized to **512 × 512 pixels** using the **LANCZOS interpolation method** to preserve fine details and ensure standardized input size for model training.

Succesfully splitting into 80/20 - 70/30 and changing my format into 

[**Parkinson's Drawings**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/parkinsons-drawings) by "K Scott Mader"

Uploading it into 

- 70/30 Drawing : [**Parkinson's Drawings**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/)
- 80/20 Drawing : [**Parkinson's Drawings**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/)

#### 5.55 P.M
Deciding to auto annotate the Data based on file name, rememmbering that i had already split the data name by coincidence before, with logic of : 

```
Image format 512 x 512

Make label 
0 : healthy spiral
1 : healthy wave
2 : parkinson spiral
3 : parkinson wave

For each folder who had "Healthy" in folder spiral :
- Make label 0 with full  Bounding Box (annotate full resolution of images)
Else : 
- make label 2 with full Bounding Box (annotate full resolution of images)

For each folder who had "Wave" in folder wave :
- Make label 1 with full  Bounding Box (anotate all images)
Else : 
- make label 3 with full Bounding Box (annotate full resolution of images)
```

### April 30 
dataset already Moved all into a new dataset and can be annotated Automatically for boxes, and so and so, dont seems any prolem occure during the process, keep continuing.

### Mei 1 
#### 8 AM 
Error Occure on ne Name applied there, which Some Duplicated, but the problem resolved clear

#### 10 AM 
Problem Occure when i want to simplify the Tree Directory from 

```

Into something more simpler into this path : 
```

```

Which encoutering More problem when **Name was Crashed each other**... , Logic that may solve this was 

***Auto rename it all***

#### 11.47 AM
Thanks to ChatGPT for the great help for minimalizing time, All File already Renamed.. The Workflow Should be 

```python
-> util_512Mod.py  #Resizing all image into 512
    -> util_512toYolo.py #Change into Yolo Format File
        -> util_rename.py #Change name into one format to help labelling
            -> util_autolabeling.py #Auto Label because 1 image, 1 item
                -> util_merge_to_4_class_yolo.py #merge into Train and Val Yolo Only
```
